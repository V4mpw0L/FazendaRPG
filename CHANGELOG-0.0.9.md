## üìã Summary of Changes

### üîã Energy System Improvements
- **Passive Energy Regeneration Enhanced:**
  - Increased from +1 to +5 energy per regeneration cycle
  - Continues to regenerate every 60 seconds
  - Beautiful floating notification shows "+5 ‚ö°" when energy regenerates
  - Notification appears below the energy bar with smooth upward animation
  - Energy bar pulses to indicate regeneration
  
- **Visual Feedback:**
  - Golden colored notification with glow effect
  - Smooth 2-second animation (appears ‚Üí floats up ‚Üí fades out)
  - Non-intrusive and satisfying user experience
  - Perfectly aligned with TopBar design

### üåø Weed Removal Animation (NEW!)
- **3D SVG Rake Animation:**
  - Beautiful rake tool with realistic wooden handle and metal teeth
  - 7 rake teeth for detailed appearance
  - Drop shadows for 3D depth effect
  
- **Animation Phases:**
  1. **Entry (0-15%):** Rake enters from the left with fade-in
  2. **Sweep (15-70%):** Rake sweeps across the plot, clearing weeds
  3. **Exit (70-100%):** Rake exits to the right with fade-out
  
- **Weed Particle Physics:**
  - 20 weed particles with leaf-like shapes
  - Green color variations (bright and dark green)
  - Weeds remain still until rake reaches them
  - Scatter in random directions when touched by rake
  - Tumbling rotation and spin effects
  - Perspective 3D scaling as they fly away
  - Smooth fade-out as they disappear
  
- **Duration:** 1.4 seconds (1400ms)
- **Integration:** Automatically plays when clearing weeds from plots
- **Requirements:** Player must have Hoe or Rake tool

### üé® Visual Polish
- **Market UI Consistency:**
  - Item quantity badge now uses green gradient matching inventory
  - Background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #5caa1f, #4a8e19)`
  - Added white border and text shadow for better visibility
  - Maintains visual harmony across all UI elements

## üîß Technical Details

### Service Worker Cache
- **Cache Name Updated:** `fazendarpg-v0.0.8` ‚Üí `fazendarpg-v0.0.9`
- Forces clients to fetch fresh assets and clear old cached versions

### Save Data Compatibility
- All save data now includes version `0.0.9` in metadata
- Export functionality includes version `0.0.9` for compatibility tracking
- Backward compatible with v0.0.8 saves

### Performance
- New animations use requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps
- Efficient SVG rendering with minimal DOM manipulation
- Automatic cleanup after animations complete
- No memory leaks or performance degradation

---

## üé® Animation System Architecture

All farm animations now follow a consistent pattern:

1. **FertilizerAnimation** - Sparkle particles for fertilizing
2. **PlantAnimation** - Seeds falling and planting
3. **HarvestAnimation** - Crops flying into inventory
4. **WeedRemovalAnimation** - Rake sweeping and weeds scattering ‚Üê NEW!

Each animation:
- Uses SVG for crisp, scalable graphics
- Implements 3D-like effects with transforms and scaling
- Has smooth easing functions
- Cleans up automatically
- Can be cancelled if needed

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### For Developers
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Verify Service Worker updated to v0.0.9
3. Check console for version logs showing 0.0.9
4. Test energy regeneration notification appears correctly
5. Test weed removal animation on farm plots with weeds
6. Verify all animations remain smooth and synchronized

### For Players
1. **Energy System:**
